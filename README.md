## BikeShare project

### This project and readme files were created in May 2020


### Description
The BikeShare datasets contain information about bike share systems in Chicago, New York and Washington. This BikeShare python code was created to load the datasets and compute statistics for each city. The statistics can be computed from January to June 2017 or by a specific month and/or day between these months.

Some of the statistics computed in this project are:
* Most Popular Start Hour
* Most Popular Start Station
* Most Popular End Station
* Most Popular Start and End Station Combination
* Average Travel Time
* Longest trip
